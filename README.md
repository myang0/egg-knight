This game is a semester-long project that was made for the course [IAT 140](http://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2021/fall/iat/410/e100). Made by Karson Nguyen, Catelyn Sue, and Matthew Yang, we hope you enjoy it!

# Overview

With the esteemed royal egg knight Sir Loin assassinated, the kingdom of Egg's Landing is defenseless and the throne is easily usurped by the assassin herself, Lady Eggna. Unbeknownst to her, Sir Loin is alive, and on a journey to reclaim the throne and crush Eggna and her minions.

Egg Knight is a 2D top-down roguelike game for PC. You play as Sir Loin. Armed with nothing but a knife, fork, and spoon, fight through a massive horde of enemies that are both sentient and edible. With level progression, enemy spawns, and rewards all being randomized, no two runs will be the same!
